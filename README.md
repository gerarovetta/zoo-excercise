# Zoo Project

Logic and classes to support a zoo in JavaScript where each animal species in the zoo has lots
of different, particular, behaviors, but all animals talk to each other in a similar
way. Specifically, they all implement a speak method, the output of which is the
arbitrary input string interspersed with an "animal sound" that is particular to that
type of animal.

## Project Structure :rocket:

- `zoo-excercise/`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `zoo/`: Houses all animal-related classes.
    - `animals/`: Houses all animal-related classes.
      - `Animal.js`: The base class for all animal types.
      - `Lion.js`: A class representing lions.
      - `Tiger.js`: A class representing tigers.
      - `Elephant.js`: A class representing elephants.
      - ... 
    - `zoo.js`: A class for the zoo representation.
- `index.js`: main project file.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - `test.js`: The unit test file for testing the zoo and animal classes.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.


## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the zoo in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Import the Zoo class
import Zoo from "./zoo/zoo.js";

// Create a new zoo instance
const myZoo = new Zoo();

// Make lion speak
myZoo.lion.speak();

// Make tiger speak
myZoo.lion.speak();

```
